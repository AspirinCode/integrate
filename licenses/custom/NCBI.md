**Endorsement:** NCBI does not endorse or recommend any commercial products, processes, or services. The views and opinions of authors expressed on NCBI's Web sites do not necessarily state or reflect those of the U.S. Government, and they may not be used for advertising or product endorsement purposes.

**External Links:** Some NCBI Web pages may provide links to other Internet sites for the convenience of users. NCBI is not responsible for the availability or content of these external sites, nor does NCBI endorse, warrant, or guarantee the products, services, or information described or offered at these other Internet sites.

It is the responsibility of the user to examine the copyright and licensing restrictions of linked pages and to secure all necessary permissions.

## Website Usage

This site is maintained by the U.S. Government and is protected by various provisions of Title 18 of the U.S. Code. Violations of Title 18 are subject to criminal prosecution in a federal court. For site security purposes, as well as to ensure that this service remains available to all users, we use software programs to monitor traffic and to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise cause damage. In the event of authorized law enforcement investigations and pursuant to any required legal process, information from these sources may be used to help identify an individual.

## Copyright Status of Webpages

Information that is created by or for the US government on this site is within the public domain. Public domain information on the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Web pages may be freely distributed and copied. However, it is requested that in any subsequent use of this work, NLM be given appropriate acknowledgment.

NOTE: This site contains resources which incorporate material contributed or licensed by individuals, companies, or organizations that may be protected by U.S. and foreign copyright laws. These include, but are not limited to PubMed Health (see [PubMed Health Copyright and Restrictions Notice][2]), PubMed Central (PMC) (see [PMC Copyright Notice][3]), Bookshelf (see [Bookshelf Copyright Notice][4]), OMIM (see [OMIM Copyright Status][5]), and PubChem. All persons reproducing, redistributing, or making commercial use of this information are expected to adhere to the terms and conditions asserted by the copyright holder. Transmission or reproduction of protected items beyond that allowed by [fair use][6] (PDF) as defined in the copyright laws requires the written permission of the copyright owners.

## Molecular Data Usage

Databases of molecular data on the NCBI Web site include such examples as nucleotide sequences (GenBank), protein sequences, macromolecular structures, molecular variation, gene expression, and mapping data. They are designed to provide and encourage access within the scientific community to sources of current and comprehensive information. Therefore, NCBI itself places no restrictions on the use or distribution of the data contained therein. Nor do we accept data when the submitter has requested restrictions on reuse or redistribution. However, some submitters of the original data (or the country of origin of such data) may claim patent, copyright, or other intellectual property rights in all or a portion of the data (that has been submitted). NCBI is not in a position to assess the validity of such claims and since there is no transfer of rights from submitters to NCBI, NCBI has no rights to transfer to a third party. Therefore, NCBI cannot provide comment or unrestricted permission concerning the use, copying, or distribution of the information contained in the molecular databases.

## Use of Web Browsers

The NCBI web site supports the current release of Chrome, Firefox and Safari, and the previous two versions. It also supports IE9 and newer versions. "Supports" means that NCBI will actively work to identify and fix bugs. For advice on how to adjust web browser parameters to optimize use and accessibility of the NCBI website, please see [Browser Advice][7] for NCBI Web Pages.

## Accessibility Policy

As a Center within the National Library of Medicine (NLM), the NCBI is making every effort to ensure that the information available on our Web site is accessible to all. Please see the [NLM's Accessibility Policy][8], for more information.
